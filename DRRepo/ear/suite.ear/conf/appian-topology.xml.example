  Create a file named appian-topology.xml

  Below are some examples of topology files
  that can be used.

<!--
  DEFAULT TOPOLOGY
  Starting from the base port, each engine takes the next two consecutive
  ports, one for the gateway, the other one for the database.
  In this case, forums will take 5000 for the gateway and 5001 for the db.
  Notify will take 5002 for the gateway and 5003 for the db, and so on.
  The gateway id are automatically inferred if not explicitly defined as an
  attribute on the engine elements.

  The default topology has a single search server listening on port 9300.
  The ports for the search server nodes in the search cluster are independent
  of the ports allocated for the engines.

<!--
  MULTIPLE GATEWAYS IN TWO DIFFERENT MACHINES, 3 NODE SEARCH CLUSTER
  This example illustrates the ability to define a diverse topology
  with an asymmetrical allocation of engines and search nodes
  across machines.

  Please make sure not to use "localhost" when distributing
  the application across different machines. In this case both 
  machines will start allocating ports for the engines from 5000, 
  but it can be overridden by using a "port" attribute in the 
  "server" element.
  
  The personalization engine has gateway 1 and 2 on machine 1 
  and gateway 3 and 4 on machine 2. The process-analytics engine has 
  gateways 1, 2, 3, and 4 all on machine 2.

  The search cluster has nodes on machines 1, 2, and 3. The port
  for each search server node has been explicitly defined, but could
  have been set at the cluster level, in which case each search server
  node would have received the same port (or auto-allocated the next
  port if more than one search server was on the same machine).
